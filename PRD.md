\# PRD – Palette (Creative Workflow Tool)

\#\# Product Idea Summary  
Palette is a creative workflow web app designed for creatives who need inspiration across multiple mediums. Instead of juggling Spotify, TMDb/IMDb, and Pinterest-style moodboards separately, Palette curates and organizes playlists, films, designers, and visual inspiration into a single workflow.  

Users can:  
\- Input their favorite songs, films, or designers → Palette builds a cross-modal board.    
\- Or chat with an AI creative assistant → Palette assembles a board aligned with their aesthetic or project theme.    
\- Export or save curated boards for reuse in campaigns, set design, or creative briefs.    
\- (Optional, stretch) AI-generated visuals (Stable Diffusion \+ LoRA adapters) to complement moodboards.  

\---

\#\# Target Users  
\- Creative directors (campaign planning)    
\- Brand strategists (vibe boards for pitches)    
\- Production & set designers (cross-modal references)    
\- Gen Z creatives & students (personal aesthetic exploration)    
\- Content creators (quick inspiration across music, film, fashion)  

\---

\#\# Context / Motivation  
Creative work often requires \*\*cross-modal inspiration\*\* (matching music to visuals, or fashion to film aesthetics). Current workflows are fragmented across multiple platforms.  

Palette reduces friction by:    
\- Automating discovery    
\- Centralizing music, film, and fashion curation    
\- Acting as a creative co-pilot for brainstorming and mood-setting  

\---

\#\# Goals  
\- Deliver a seamless creative workflow for inspiration and ideation    
\- Provide both structured workflows (form-based input) and exploratory workflows (AI assistant)    
\- Support practical use cases (project prep, campaign design) and personal exploration    
\- Showcase AI as a collaborative creative partner, not just a recommender  

\---

\#\# Use Cases  
\- A brand strategist preps a pitch deck: Palette generates moodboards \+ playlists matching the campaign theme    
\- A set designer references Palette boards to align costume, set, and soundtrack    
\- A student creative explores aesthetics: “dark academia” → films, music, designers, visuals    
\- A content creator finds new ideas by chatting with the AI assistant: \*“make me a surrealist-inspired board”\*  

\---

\#\# Features (MVP Scope)  
\- Spotify integration → generate playlists from vibes    
\- TMDb API → curated film recommendations (with IMDb cross-reference)    
\- Unsplash \+ Tumblr → fashion and moodboard images    
\- Two workflows:    
  \- Form-based (structured input)    
  \- AI assistant (chat-based brainstorming)    
\- Exportable boards → PDFs, share links, or creative briefs    
\- AI rationale for each board: “why these elements fit your vibe”    
\- Eval panel → similarity metrics, vibe alignment, tag coverage    
\- (Optional, stretch) Stable Diffusion visuals to generate unique moodboard images  

\---

\#\# Stretch Features (LoRA)  
\- LoRA-based \*\*aesthetic adapters\*\*: fine-tuned lightweight models trained on curated datasets (e.g., \*dark academia\*, \*Y2K fashion\*, \*film noir posters\*)    
\- Designer & brand LoRAs: small datasets of fashion brands (e.g., Rick Owens, Prada) to reflect their style in generated visuals    
\- Film poster LoRAs: finetune on poster datasets to produce cinematic styles    
\- Eval integration: compare baseline vs. LoRA outputs with similarity and vibe alignment scores  

\---

\#\# Technical Stack  
\*\*Frontend\*\*    
\- Next.js (App Router) \+ Tailwind CSS  

\*\*Backend / API\*\*    
\- Next.js API routes (serverless) or FastAPI microservice for embeddings  

\*\*Auth & Integrations (MVP)\*\*    
\- Spotify API (music)    
\- TMDb API (films)    
\- Unsplash API (moodboard images)    
\- Tumblr API (aesthetic/community-sourced images)  

\*\*Auth & Integrations (Future)\*\*    
\- Spotify login → personalized recommendations based on user playlists    
\- Pinterest login → vibe boards generated from user pins    
\- Tumblr login → recommendations from followed blogs/tags  

\*\*AI Models\*\*    
\- CLIP (Hugging Face) for embeddings & aesthetic matching    
\- Sentence-Transformers for text similarity    
\- Claude / OpenAI / Llama-based LLM for rationale \+ assistant mode    
\- Stable Diffusion for image generation (stretch)    
\- LoRA fine-tuning for consistent visual styles (stretch)  

\*\*Database / Storage\*\*    
\- Supabase / PostgreSQL for users, boards, embeddings    
\- Cloudinary / Uploadcare for images  

\*\*Analytics / Evals\*\*    
\- PostHog for user analytics    
\- Custom eval panel for vibe alignment, tag overlap, and time saved  

\*\*Deployment\*\*    
\- Vercel (frontend \+ serverless) and/or Hugging Face Spaces  

\---

\#\# Success Metrics  
\- Workflow adoption: % of users building ≥2 boards per week    
\- Cross-modal use: % of boards containing more than one medium (music \+ film \+ fashion)    
\- Export/share rate: \# of boards shared externally    
\- Creative feedback: qualitative feedback on usefulness for real creative workflows  

\---

\#\# Risks & Challenges  
\- API limitations (Tumblr, Pinterest access, Spotify rate limits)    
\- Convincing creatives Palette is a \*\*workflow enhancer\*\*, not just a toy recommender    
\- Balancing aesthetics vs. usability (ensuring outputs are practical, not just pretty)    
\- Cold-start problem (new users with sparse inputs)  

\---

\#\# Next Steps  
1\. Build structured form workflow (input → curated board)    
2\. Add AI assistant workflow (chat → curated board)    
3\. Integrate Spotify \+ TMDb APIs (stable \+ widely used)    
4\. Add Unsplash \+ Tumblr integrations for visuals    
5\. Layer in export features (PDFs, sharable links)    
6\. Stretch: experiment with Stable Diffusion \+ LoRA for cohesive aesthetic visuals
