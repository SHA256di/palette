# palette üé® : a creative workflow curator  

**palette** is an AI-powered web app that helps users turn a vibe, product, or aesthetic into a curated moodboard in seconds.  

Instead of manually pulling references from Spotify, TMDb, Discogs, Unsplash, and Tumblr, palette generates a **shareable aesthetic board** that combines playlists, films, album covers, visuals, quotes, and rationale into a single, deck-ready output.  

The app works in two modes:  

---

## Structured Workflow  
Users fill out a clean form with:  
- A vibe or product name (e.g., *‚Äúpink pilates princess‚Äù*, *‚Äúwindsurf startup‚Äù*)  
- Optional brand context (audience, platform, purpose)  

Palette then uses embeddings (CLIP + sentence-transformers) and APIs (Spotify, Last.fm, TMDb, Discogs, Unsplash, Tumblr) to assemble a **cross-media board**.

## Creative Assistant  
A chat-based AI curator lets users free-prompt their vision (e.g., ‚Äúmake me a *girlblogger aesthetic board* around Diet Coke‚Äù). The assistant parses the input into structured tags and regenerates a board with refinement loops like:  
- ‚ÄúMake it darker‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúMore Y2K‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúAdd Lana Del Rey references‚Äù  

---

## Output  
Each board is **moodboard-first**: a white-background collage layout with:  
- Spotify embeds + Last.fm tags (music)  
- Film posters/loglines (TMDb)  
- Album covers (Discogs)  
- Aesthetic visuals (Unsplash, Tumblr)  
- Quotes or phrases pulled from APIs or LLMs  
- Optional product placement (logos, new products contextualized among familiar items)  

Boards can be:  
- Exported as PDF/PNG slides  
- Shared via link  
- Iterated with AI
