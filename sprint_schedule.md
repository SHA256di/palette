## CURRENT PRIORITY â€“ AI Enhancement Phase

### Phase 1 â€“ AI-Powered Image Analysis ðŸ”„
**Objectives**
- Research AI/ML services for image analysis (OpenAI CLIP, Replicate, etc.)
- Implement semantic image matching beyond just tags
- Add image embedding generation for better aesthetic matching
- Enhance Tumblr results using AI quality scoring

**Target Deliverables**
- More accurate aesthetic matching using visual embeddings
- AI-powered quality filtering for better curation

- Create hybrid search: user image + text description â†’ similar Tumblr content
- Build UI for image upload and mixed search workflows

**Target Deliverables**
- User uploads reference image â†’ system finds visually similar aesthetic content
- Combined text + visual search for highly accurate moodboards

## FUTURE PHASES â€“ Post-AI Enhancement

### Phase 3 â€“ Moodboard Layout & Export System ðŸ“‹
**Objectives** (Previously Day 4-5, now refined)
- Build advanced moodboard layout system with AI-curated content
- Implement collage-style rendering with proper spacing and aesthetics  
- Add export functionality: PNG, PDF, shareable links

**Target Deliverables**
- AI-enhanced moodboards with better visual composition
- Multiple export formats working
- Persistent board sharing via unique URLs

---

### Phase 4 â€“ Advanced Workflow Features ðŸ“‹
**Objectives** (Previously Day 5-6, now enhanced)
